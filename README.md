# VRHandViz
Utilizes a R script to convert hand-tracking data into a .csv file and then reads in the .csv file to display hand tracking data in 3D 

Use the script in convertHandDatatoCSV.Rmd to create a .csv file and place it where the Unity project can read it. Make sure that the hand tracking data is formatted in the same way that the example 
participant file is formatted.
